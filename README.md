Morning Rituals
=============

Morning Rituals is a small game developed during the Global Game Jam 2016, under the jam's theme umbrella of rituals.

The game explores the little rituals we need to do every morning, which get us started for the day. Brush your teeth, have a cup of coffee.

How to Play
