Morning Rituals
=============

Morning Rituals is a small game developed during the Global Game Jam 2016, under the jam's theme umbrella of rituals.

The game explores the little rituals we need to do every morning, which get us started for the day. Brush your teeth, have a cup of coffee.

How to Play
-------

* The game is played on a PC or a Mac
* You will be shown ritual tasks, which you need to complete
* Humans are bad at multitasking. If your task load goes higher than nine, the game ends.
* Tap letters on your keyboard as diplayed on some of the tasks
* Slide sliders from one end to the other until task disappears
* On a task with a button, tap it as many times as displayed on the button
